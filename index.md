# Weena Lualhati

Weena Lualhati came across a video tutorial about Git. The speaker mentioned that **Git Flavored Markdown \(GFM\)** language is used in writing *README.md* files. She wants to practice \(GFM\) and did a lot of research about markdown. She was thinking of applying everything in one article as she firmly believes in a quote by Tony Robbins,

> \"It’s not knowing what to do, it’s doing what you know.\”

## New York laboratories

### Tesla coil
Tesla found the discoveries of __Heinrich Hertz__ refreshing and decided to repeat the experiment but found that the high frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his Tesla coil with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.
 
### Wireless lighting
Tesla attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. 

### Radio remote control
Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed "_telautomaton_"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. He tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military progra
