# Weena Lualhati

Weena Lualhati came across a video tutorial about Git. The speaker mentioned that **Git Flavored Markdown \(GFM\)** language is used in writing *README.md* files. She wants to practice \(GFM\) and did a lot of research about markdown. She was thinking of applying everything in one article as she firmly believes in a quote by Tony Robbins,

> \"It’s not knowing what to do, it’s doing what you know.\”

[Markdown] (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown by John Gruber") is designed for web writers as a text-to-HTML conversion tool

### Basic Syntax

In 2004, [John Gruber] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) created the markdown markup language

#### Headings
In writing this article, various heading levels were used by adding hash sign \#. The hash sign is proportional to the level of heading. For example, Heading 4 is written with 4 hash keys in the begining, *\#\#\#\# Heading 4*. Alternatively, equal sign *\=* is placed under the Heading 1 text while minus sign *\-* is used for Heading 2.

#### Paragraphs
To add another paragraph, just add a space under your first paragraph. To avoid unexpected formating language, one should avoid putting space or tab in the first word of the sentence.

#### Line Breaks
Often times, trailing whitespace, the use of two or more spaces to make a line break, and use of \<br\> HTML tag are use to make a line break. There are other ways to create a line space but according to <https://www.markdownguide.org/>,for line breaks best practices, the use of backslash \(\|\) and the return key are often discouraged as it is not commonly accepted in other Markdown application.

#### Lists
Like HTML, there are two ways to make a list: ordered and unordered.

##### Ordered
All numbers should start with number 1 and every part of the list should have a number and a period in the beginning.

1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three
   1. Number three point one
   2. Number three point two
4. Number four
   1. Number four point one
   1. Number four point two

##### Unordered

#### Codes

#### Horizontal Rules

#### Links 

#### Images

#### Escaping Characters

#### HTML


### Extended Syntax
